# Comprehensive-EDA-on-Heart-Disease-UCI-Dataset-Analysis
 Pandas | Numpy | Seaborn | Matplotlib

Overview:
This project involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of the Heart Disease UCI dataset using Python. The dataset contains various medical attributes related to heart disease, and the goal is to analyze the data to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that can help in understanding the factors contributing to heart disease.

Key Features: 
1.Data Exploration:

The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure, including the shape, data types, and summary statistics.

Key features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and target (presence of heart disease) are analyzed.

Univariate Analysis:

The distribution of the target variable (presence of heart disease) is visualized using count plots.

The frequency distribution of the target variable with respect to sex is analyzed and visualized.

2.Bivariate Analysis:

Correlation coefficients between different features are estimated.

The relationship between the target variable and other features like chest pain type (cp) and maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) is explored.

3.Multivariate Analysis:

Heatmaps and pair plots are used to visualize the relationships between multiple features.

The correlation between different features is analyzed to identify significant relationships.

4.Handling Missing Values:

Techniques to detect and handle missing values in the dataset are discussed.

Functions like isnull() and notnull() are used to identify missing data.

5.Outlier Detection:

Methods to detect outliers in the dataset are explored to ensure data quality.

6.Visualization:

Various plots such as count plots, bar plots, and heatmaps are used to visualize the data distributions and relationships.

Customizations like color palettes and horizontal bar plots are applied to enhance the visual appeal.
